**Q4** If server-side functionality were added to the form, it would have facilitated various tasks such as storing submitted data in a database for future reference, sending email notifications to designated recipients, managing user authentication and session data securely, processing submitted information for personalized user experiences, and integrating with external services or APIs to perform additional actions such as payment processing or data validation. Overall, server-side functionality would have enhanced the form's capabilities by enabling data storage, processing, and interaction with external systems, thereby improving the website's functionality and user experience.
